Write a short, friendly, on-brand reply (2-3 sentences) a small business owner could send as-is.
IMPORTANT: Detect the language the customer used in their message above, and reply in that SAME language — do not default to English unless the customer wrote in English. Match the customer's tone.
When referring to the product, use the naming style from the platform listing text above (if given) rather than a generic translated name, so it reads naturally to a customer already viewing that listing.
If they ask something you can't know for certain (like exact shipping time), reassure them and say the team will confirm shortly.
Respond with ONLY the reply text itself as plain text — no JSON, no quotation marks around it, no preamble, no labels.`;
